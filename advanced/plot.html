        <h2>Kill Bill Volume II</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <b>Opening credits</b>
            <br> A black and white scene shows Beatrix Kiddo in an open cabriolet. In the straight-to-camera monologue (Breaking the Fourth Wall ), she explains that her revenge is almost done and there is only one more on her list. She is now on her way to Bill to kill him.

            <li>
            <b>Chapter 6: The Two Pines Massacre</b>
            <br>The section, also in black and white, shows the Kiddos' wedding rehearsal in Two Pines. Hearing a flute tune outside, the bride leaves the church and meets Bill. There is a discussion between the two, but it remains open. Bill takes the bride to church and meets her groom there. Kiddo introduces Bill as her father, who has just arrived from Australia. Bill pretends to the guests that he's happy for them and lets Kiddo think he's reconciled to the breakup. However, Budd, Elle Driver, O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green gather outside and enter the church, heavily armed. Immediately afterwards, wild gunfire can be heard from the building.

            <b>Chapter 7: The lonely grave of Paula Schultz </b>
            <br>
            Bill meets up with his brother Budd and warns him about Kiddo. The run-down Budd lives in a trailer near Barstow (California), he loses his job as a bouncer in a striptease bar because of his unpunctuality. When he returns to the trailer, the trained killer senses the danger and lies in wait with his shotgun. He succeeds in overpowering the attacking kiddo with a shot in the upper body with rock salt and injecting her with an anesthetic. He then calls Elle Driver and offers her Kiddo's katanafor a million dollars. Driver agrees and asks Budd to murder Kiddo as cruelly as possible. Budd takes Kiddo to a cemetery in his pickup truck, puts her in a coffin, and buries her alive in a grave dug by an aide. The tombstone bears the name "Paula Schultz".

                <b>Chapter 8: The Cruel Teachings of the Pai Mei</b>
                <br>
                In her coffin, Kiddo remembers the time with the martial arts master Pai Mei, to whom Bill had sent her for training. Before the training begins, Bill advises her to obey all of Pai Mei's instructions without objection, otherwise he will rip out an eye or kill her. In this scene, Bill says that Pai Mei is the only one who has mastered the deadly " Five Point Pressure Heart Burst Technique " that he doesn't share with anyone. Despite the aversion and brutality of the racist, misogynist and anti-American Pai Mei, she manages to get through the training with him with extreme willpower.

After getting over her initial panic in the coffin, Kiddo breaks free of her bonds with the help of a razor she kept hidden in one of her boots. Using short-range, well-aimed punches she learned from Pai Mei, she smashes the coffin lid, digs up, and emerges from the tomb, smeared with dark earth. She makes her way back to Budd's trailer.

                <b>Chapter 9: Elle and I </b>
                <br>
                Kiddo arrives in the mountains above the trailer when Elle Driver pulls up there to buy the katana sword Kiddo had stolen from Budd. After talking to Driver, Budd opens the suitcase containing the million dollars and takes out the wads of bills. However, a Black Mamba hidden by Driver lurks beneath the top layer and bites Budd's face. Budd dies within minutes. Driver notifies Bill of his brother's and kiddos' deaths over the phone.

When Driver wants to leave the trailer, she is surprised and attacked by Kiddo. A fierce duel ensues between the two women in the trailer, during which Kiddo finds Budd's supposedly sold katana sword in the trailer. When asked about the loss of her eye by Kiddo, Driver, who was also a student of Pai Mei, says she called him "disgusting old monkey" and he ripped out her right eye for it. Driver goes on to say that she then poisoned the martial arts master. This increases Kiddo's anger and the two women resume the fight. Using the sudden grip learned from Pai Mei, Kiddo rips out Driver's left eye and crushes it with his bare foot. She leaves the trailer in which the screaming and thrashing driver,

                <b>Final Chapter: Face to Face</b>
                <br>
                Now in search of Bill, the last person involved in the massacre, Kiddo drives to Mexico. From the old brothel operator Don Esteban, who had temporarily raised the fatherless Bill as a surrogate father, she learns his address. When Kiddo breaks into Bill's house armed in the evening, she surprises Bill and their 4-year-old daughter BB while they are playing. After BB goes to sleep, Kiddo and Bill discuss how to settle their argument. However, since Bill still has some questions for Kiddo that he wants answered truthfully, he injects her with a truth serum using a tranquilizer gun . By association with Supermanand to his feeble camouflage figure Clark Kent, he explains to Kiddo that, as a born killer, she wasn't cut out for the middle-class life to which she wanted to flee. His crucial question is why Kiddo wanted to leave him.

Another flashback shows Kiddo carrying out a murder contract. Since she felt nauseous the morning she arrived at the scene of the attack, she took a quick pregnancy test in the hotel room – the test was positive. The assassination victim found out about the assassination attempt and in turn sent a female killer against Kiddo. Kiddo narrowly escapes the counterattack and is able to convince the opponent that she is pregnant and fears for her unborn child.

As Bill and Kiddo continue to argue, both draw their katana swords and fight each other. Bill knocks the sword out of her hand, and when he counterattacks, Kiddo catches his sword in her empty scabbard. Kiddo then punches him five times in the chest with his fingertips - Pai Mei taught her the "five-point pressure heart explosion technique". After that the fight is decided. Bill and Kiddo say goodbye to each other, Bill takes five steps into the garden and collapses.

With her sleeping daughter in her arms, Kiddo leaves the house and drives away. The next morning, BB is sitting in a hotel room in front of the TV watching cartoons while her mother is crying on the floor in the adjoining bathroom. Her crying turns into laughter, and she says "thank you" several times before wiping her tears and going over to her daughter to watch TV with her. The film ends with the phrase “ The lioness has rejoined her cub. And all is right in the jungle. (“The lioness has her cub back. And all is well in the jungle.”)
