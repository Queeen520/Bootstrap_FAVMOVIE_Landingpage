        <p>Thurman began her professional career as a model, following her mother's example, before she was discovered for the big screen. One of her first known roles was as June Miller in Henry & June opposite Fred Ward . With nominations for an Oscar and a Golden Globe , she got her international breakthrough in 1994 for the role of the self-destructive gangster bride Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino's cult film Pulp Fiction . This was followed by less successful leading roles, such as in the vision of the future Gattaca , in the comic film Batman & Robin(both 1997) and in a theatrical version of the British television series Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (1998) , which was considered by critics and audiences to have had an accident .

            In 2003, she received a Golden Globe for her role in the TV movie Hysterical Blindness , and made a comeback as a co-writer, again collaborating with Tarantino, as the avenging bride in Kill Bill - Volume 1 and Volume 2 . With the success of the two-piece, she found international attention again and also received endorsement deals from the cosmetics company Lanc√¥me and the luxury brand Louis Vuitton . Her fee in dollars per film climbed into the tens of millions. [2] In 2005 she was in the comedy Couchwhispera woman in her late thirties who falls in love with a man nearly fifteen years her junior, who turns out to be the son of her therapist (portrayed by Meryl Streep ). In the comedy Die Super-Ex by director Ivan Reitman , she appeared in 2006 as a superheroine who takes revenge on her ex-boyfriend for being dumped. In 2007, Thurman starred in the internet action short Mission Zero , directed by Kathryn Bigelow for Pirelli . The 2010 film New York Mom starring her was a worldwide flop. In the horror film Down a Dark HallFrom 2018, Thurman embodies the strict director of a stately boarding school alongside actress Isabelle Fuhrman in order to lead five difficult girls back to the path of virtue, with dead artists and mathematicians communicating with this world about the musical talents of the convicted students, as with one medium to complete her unfinished life's work.
            
            Thurman was made a Knight of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2006. In 2011 she sat on the competition jury at the 64th Cannes International Film Festival . Six years later she was selected as Jury President of the Un Certain Regard section at the 70th Cannes Film Festival .
