        <h1>Movie Reviews</h1>

            James Berardinelli wrote on <i>ReelViews</i> that the film is - in contrast to its predecessor - an independent film. 
            However, the "egocentric filmmaker" should have cut out about 30 minutes to make the film "leaner". It contains less action than the first part, but more dialogue. 
            One tries to “build up” the characters of Beatrix Kiddo and Bill. Berardinelli wrote that Uma Thurman played her role better than in the first part, 
            which had a wider range than in the first part. David Carradine seems "calm" and "mature". Michael Madsen is "laconic as always", Daryl Hannah plays a killer "against her type". 
        <br> <br>
            The encyclopedia of international film wrote that the film was "full of quotes and cross-references". He fascinates with "the furious use of numerous cinematic means", 
            proves to be an "ambiguous experiment" and, through David Carradine, also "his homage to American television history".

        Peter Bradshaw wrote for The Guardian - "I'm the deadliest woman in the world - but right now, I'm just scared shitless about my baby!" With these words, Uma Thurman's pregnant Bride puts the finishing touches to her iconic status: flinging her description defiantly, imploringly, at a would-be assassin. This second part of Quentin Tarantino's gruesomely violent, deliriously brilliant pulp-guignol shocker is destined to see Uma fully assume the mantle of warrior queen, martial arts mom, and for all I know, first gay diva of the Shaolin Temple.
        Once again, with an insouciant blaze of energy and style, Tarantino has seen off the imitators, detractors and condescenders. True, the Kill Bill films do not have the dialogue riffs of his earlier work co-scripted with Roger Avary, apart from one small verbal arabesque here about Superman and Clark Kent. But as any screenplay handbook will tell you, writing for motion pictures is not about penning lines of dialogue; it is about fashioning a narrative and constructing an event. Kill Bill just seems to bypass the rational filters which impede the respectable films and attacks the endorphin centres of the brain.
        
        For volume two, the Bride has a different stylist. She has put aside the yellow-and-black tracksuit, based on the outfit Bruce Lee wore in his unfinished film Game of Death, opting instead for more tactful civilian garb, including a nondescript hoodie worn as a hunched pyjama top, and - for her final showdown with Bill - a startlingly demure and feminine combination. She models a delicate frilly skirt and pale top designed to show her enviable skin-tones, but which is surely not a martial arts movie allusion - unless there's a lost scene in Fist of Fury where Bruce Lee goes shopping at Monsoon.
        
        The project remains exactly the same: revenge, a dish gobbled up piping hot. She's out to get her ex-lover Bill, who, with his murderous minions, massacred her Groom and wedding guests and put her in a coma by, as she grimly summarises it, "busting a cap in her crown". In Volume One, she took out O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox). Now she has the poisonous one-eyed killer Elle (Daryl Hannah) in her sights along with Bill's trailer-trash brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and finally the sinister kingpin Bill himself, played with lizardly charisma by David Carradine.
        
        Just as in the first part, everything happens in a weightless comic-book universe where the normal rules of physical existence have been abolished, or at any rate extensively modified. It's a world in which international travel and the purchase of new cars may be achieved without money, a world where people can ascend six feet unaided through an earth pit, where they can fire guns indoors without disturbing a sleeping child in the next room - a world where a pump-action-totin' killer can blow a hole in a hotel room door without attracting the attention of security. But it is all brazenly played with the same unflinching naturalistic conviction.
        
        David Carradine is the film's triumph; his delayed, climactic appearance itself justifies the slicing of Kill Bill into two. Delayed in a larger sense, too: despite a string of screen credits, this outstanding actor and natural star seems to have been in cold storage for 30 years since the days of the old Kung Fu TV show when he "walked the earth", as Samuel L Jackson says in Pulp Fiction. Now he shows up unannounced with his passive-aggressive Chinese flute at The Bride's wedding rehearsal, like Caine gone to the bad.
        
        Bill is the spurned older lover, nursing a broken heart, chillingly calm and dangerous with a weird lispy drawl, smilingly decorous as The Bride nervously asks if he's going to be "nice" and coldly accepting the insulting subterfuge that he is her father. As he sits down in the congregation, and we all know the truth of what is about to happen, Robert Rodriguez's musical score excels itself. Massively portentous chords blare out, like a bizarre cross between the Fistful of Dollars theme and Siegfried's Funeral Music by Wagner.
        
        There are plenty more horribly gripping scenes: the Bride is nailed into a coffin by the unspeakable Budd, who wants to bury her alive - a hardcore moment of fear and horror that cuts to a flashback of the Bride's instruction in Chinese martial arts by the haughty master Pai Mei, wonderfully played by Gordon Liu. The Bride's swordfight with Elle is conducted at close quarters in Budd's manky caravan: a bravura combat scene, with some of Tarantino's signature overhead-interior shots. But her encounter with Bill is a more a duel of words than blows.
        
        So the Bride continues on her bloodthirsty way, a heroine with no love interest save for her bizarre, unexamined Electra complex, attached to a series of older men: Pai Mei, Bill and Bill's own unpleasant mentor - father figure Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks). How many other films whisk you around the world so exuberantly and persuade you that an action star should have a mastery, or at least respectful approach to foreign languages: in this case Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish?
        
        I am just so bemused by pundits who airily declare themselves "underwhelmed" by Kill Bill but who apparently adjust their whelm-altitude downwards for duller middleweight Hollywood products. Both films have a pedal-to-the-metal exhilaration, sporting effortlessly with the texture and style of martial arts and action genres and making of them something vividly new, compulsively entertaining and exquisitely modern.
